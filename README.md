# Weatherpy
The objective of this script was to take 500 cities from across the globe and map out their the type of weather they would have compared to the equator. Obviously it gets warmer but we want to graphically represent what happens. 

Your objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
 
 * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
 * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
 * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
 * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
